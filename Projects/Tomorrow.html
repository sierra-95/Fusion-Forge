                    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
                    <p>Have you ever sat down and wondered, if I were to build something for my own use, something
                        comprehensive that would have everything I ever needed, what would it be? Well, I found myself in this
                        situation in early March 2024. I researched and thought hard for days, but couldn’t identify anything I
                        desperately needed. My focus shifted from designing something essential to a project I would do for fun
                        while gaining valuable skills. This is how I came up with the project Tomorrow!                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tomorrow is a personal task manager, a web application designed to assist users in organizing and
                        managing their tasks efficiently. The catchphrase was “Imagine having your own calendar organized to
                        your liking”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project specialized in creating personal task management solutions tailored just for the user. A
                        stress-free tomorrow, where tasks are effortlessly managed, and goals are within reach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tomorrow’s culture:
                        “We embrace challenges with enthusiasm and foster an environment that encourages creativity,
                        collaboration, and continuous improvement. Together, we shape a tomorrow where productivity knows
                        no bounds”
                    </p>
                </section>

                        productivity. we bring your ideas to life.”</p>
                    <p> 1. Task Priority: A user could easily prioritize and organize to-dos, ensuring that he focus on what
                        matters most. One could integrate the high-priority tasks with Tomorrow’s calendar, receive
                        instant event confirmation emails, and never miss an important deadline. “Take control of your
                        schedule and enhance your productivity. Your tasks, your priorities, effortlessly managed in one
                        place”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Productivity analysis: Users could track their time, task response, and task completion times
                        effortlessly. They would be able to gain valuable data-driven insights to optimize their workflow,
                        identify trends, and enhance their efficiency. “Stay informed, make informed decisions, and
                        elevate your productivity game with our comprehensive analysis tools.”
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. Goal tracking: Users would be able to send
                        letters to their future self, set and achieve
                        milestones, and nurture personal growth. They
                        could also be able to explore curated
                        recommendations for insightful books and
                        impactful speeches, fostering continuous selfdevelopment. “Transform your ambitions into
                        reality with a dedicated space that empowers
                        you to plan, reflect, and progress towards the
                        best version of yourself.”

                    <p>1. Task management</p>
                    <p> Project Tomorrow allowed users to create events using a
                        dynamic calendar, manage them by editing or deleting
                        them via a side panel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An automated email system was implemented to confirm
                        events have been saved, and also a reminder email 1 day
                        prior to the D-day
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Future Me section was where account users could
                        create Future Me letters. It had a panel that showed
                        how many letters a user has written and the delivery
                        date. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Delivery of the letters was via automated email as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The productivity analysis section was where analysis was
                        done on time management, task responsiveness and
                        time taken to complete a task

                    <h2>Architecture:</h2>
                    <p>The project is outlined in three main phases: data population, data storage, and data projection.</p>
                    <p> 1. Data Population:
                        Data population was mainly based on user
                        data. Users could create accounts and sign in. Data was based on
                        their tasks and Future me letters
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Data Storage:
                        Data entered by users was mapped using MySQL
                        connector to a MySQL database, where it awaited retrieval and
                        posting for users to access.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. Data Projection:
                        The project includes a user-friendly web
                        dashboard created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front
                        end.
                        Flask was employed for back-end development due to its
                        simplicity. Data is visualized and monitored through this interface.

                    <h2>Technologies used:</h2>
                    <p>1.  Html and CSS – Used for creating static website for the
                        landing and project page
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. JavaScript- Used frontend/client side js for event handling(
                            button clicks etc), making ajax requests(for updating user
                            account details) and generally making the website dynamic.
                            
                    </p>
                    <p>3. Flask framework – Used for serving web pages and data
                        manipulation in the database. It also handled the mailing via
                        Flask Mail using SMTP
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4. Mail Trap – it’s the actual emailing system, they host my mail
                        server.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       5.  Bcrypt algorithm - Used for password encryption, hashing of
                        passwords method 2b 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6. MySQL DBMS – Used to store the user details, user events ,
                        overall user progress and user letters
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        7. Web server – nginx –I used nginx as a reverse proxy for flask
                        to serve the web pages.
                    </p>
                    <p>8. SSL implementation – Let’s encrypt</p>

                    <h2>Development report:</h2>
                    <p>One of my greatest achievements is generally the project working how I pictured. Also, being
                        able to implement an automatic mailing system, and learning how to write visually appealing
                        emails has made me feel like an engineer.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>Challenges: Even though I chose to be a front-end engineer, in future I hope to be doing full stack
                        projects and this means il have to up my back-end game for better functioning projects in the
                        near future.
                            
                    </p>
                    <p>Areas of improvement- I have really improved in using flask, compared to the foundations
                        project I did on a sensor logger
                    </p>
                    <p>Next steps- For the big part, I will now need to figure out the algorithm or method of analysis I
                        will be using to analyze user’s data so as to make the productivity analysis more realistic
                    </p>
                    <p>Generally, I would like to make the website more dynamic and user friendly. I will implement
                        “settings” section where users can customize their environment, choose themes and apply
